# Etch-a-Sketch

Built for Project Odin, this is a project demonstrating use of the DOM. 

## Works in Progress

- Create a "fade-in" transition when painting
- Create a more colorful UI
- Configure button active/inactive states, specifically for gridlines and color modes
- Fit to accessibility standards
- Make mobile-friendly


## Known Issues

- The grayscale event listener applies to all button listeners in a way that affects the opacity of other paint modes. It also affects the opacity of the gridlines when grayscale is selected and drawn.

## Skills

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
