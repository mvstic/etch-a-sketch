# Etch-a-Sketch

Built for Project Odin, this is a project demonstrating use of the DOM. 

## Works in Progress

- Create a "fade-in" transition when painting
- Create a more colorful UI
- Configure button active/inactive states, specifically for gridlines and color modes
- Fit to accessibility standards
- Make mobile-friendly


## Known Issues

- ~The grayscale event listener applies to all button listeners in a way that affects the opacity of other paint modes.~ Fixed, but gridlines are now 1) erased by the eraser tool, and 2) affected by opacity when drawn over with grayscale. 
- Additionally, when grayscale paint is erased, grayscale no longer incrementally increases opacity.

## Skills

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
